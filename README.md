# GeneExpressionSignature: an R package for discovering functional connections using gene expression signatures

This package gives the implementations of the gene expression signature and 
its distance to each. Gene expression signature is represented as a list of 
genes whose expression is correlated with a biological state of interest. And 
its distance is defined using a nonparametric, rank-based pattern-matching 
strategy based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. Gene expression signature 
and its distance can be used to detect similarities among the signatures of
drugs, diseases, and biological states of interestã€‚

## Installation

You can install the released version of GeneExpressionSignature from [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/GeneExpressionSignature)
with:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(GeneExpressionSignature)
```

Or install the development version from github

```r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("yiluheihei/GeneExpressionSignature")
```
